# ShadowCoder

## ðŸ“–SynopsisðŸ“–

Our hero, a programmer named John, works for a large IT company and, as usual, works overtime. He falls asleep at his desk, and suddenly finds himself in a strange world where he encounters various creatures, creatures from shadows.
John needs to explore this world to find his way home. But it is not as easy as it seems. His adversaries are shadows that are not only hostile, but also try to consume him in order to add his shadow to their collection.
In this world, John encounters various creatures and events that remind him of known programming concepts and algorithms. He learns that in order to survive in this world and return to his real world, he must go through various levels and fight bosses, each of which is a symbol of some programming principle.
John uses his programming skills to overcome obstacles and battle enemies. He can use algorithms to fight enemies and solve puzzles, as well as programming tools to cross obstacles along the way.
As he progresses through the levels, John also meets various characters who can help him on his journey. For example, he may meet other programmers who will offer him new algorithms and tools, or inhabitants of the shadow world who can give him valuable hints and information.
